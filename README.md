# TG â€” Playwright Test

A simple project attempting to integrate Playwright and Testground.

## plans/playwright-test

A first basic test just to check if we can run a docker container,
with a server and a playwright script in one.

Prerequisites:
- `testground daemon` is running
- Docker

The following test case is implemented:

```
testground run single --plan playwright-test --testcase basicExpress --instances 1 --builder docker:generic --runner local:docker
```

If all is well you should in your daemon shell something along the following:

```

```

Note, first run:

```
testground plan import --from ./plans/playwright-test
```

You can run this also locally using the command:

```
yarn run testlocal
```

> This assumes that you already have ran `yarn install` prior to making this call.
